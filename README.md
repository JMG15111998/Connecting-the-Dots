# 🔄 Vulnerability Management: Lifecycle & Purpose

This repo is part of the **Vulnerability Management** course by [Josh Madar](https://www.youtube.com/@joshmadar). In this section, we tie everything together and answer the big question:  
**“What’s the point of vulnerability management?”**

---

## 🎯 Why Vulnerability Management?

The core purpose of vulnerability management is to **reduce organizational risk** — specifically, the risks tied to software, configurations, and systems.

It's just one part of a bigger Risk Management program, alongside:

- Security awareness training
- Vendor and access management
- Hiring and screening processes
- Governance and compliance

## 🔁 The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

Vulnerability Management is **cyclical** and ongoing. Here's how it works:

### 1. **Discover**
Run vulnerability scans across servers, endpoints, and cloud assets.

### 2. **Assess**
Review scan results, understand what you're dealing with.

### 3. **Prioritize**
Rank vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and system criticality.

### 4. **Report**
Generate reports for internal stakeholders (e.g. IT, security team, CIO, CISO).

### 5. **Remediate**
Patch systems, update software, change configs, remove insecure software.

### 6. **Verify**
Rescan to confirm the fix worked. If not, repeat the cycle.

> 💡 Then do it all over again. Continuously.

## 🛠️ Tools in Practice

- **Scan Engines** (internal & external)
- **Agents** on remote laptops for continuous checks
- **Tenable Console** to collect and organize data
- **Remediation Teams** to implement fixes

---

## ⚠️ Common Gotchas

- **Scanners can’t find everything** – especially zero-days.
- **Human resistance** (politics, ownership, priorities) often blocks remediation.
- **You can’t eliminate all risk**, only reduce it to an acceptable level.

## 🤔 FAQ

**Can vulnerability management guarantee 100% security?**  
> No. You can’t eliminate risk entirely — only reduce it to a manageable level.

**What makes it hard in practice?**  
> The tech is simple. The people, processes, and politics are where it gets tough.

**What happens if we skip this process?**  
> Risk piles up → threats become real → breaches, downtime, or worse.
